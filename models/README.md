# 3D Models for Molecular Structures Project

Place your GLB model files in this directory. The following models are needed:

## Required Models

1. **dna.glb** - DNA double helix structure
2. **hemoglobin.glb** - Hemoglobin molecule model
3. **glucose.glb** - Glucose molecule model
4. **caffeine.glb** - Caffeine molecule model

## Recommended Sources

   - Search for "DNA", "hemoglobin", "glucose", "caffeine"
   - Many protein/molecule models available

3. **MolView** - Generate molecular structures
   - https://molview.org/
   - Can export to various formats (may need conversion to GLB)

4. **Protein Data Bank (PDB)**
   - https://www.rcsb.org/
   - Download structures and convert to GLB format

## Download Instructions

1. Visit the recommended sources above
2. Filter by "Free" and "Downloadable"
3. Download GLB format (or convert from other formats)
4. Rename files to match the required names above
5. Place files in this `models/` directory

## File Format

- **Format**: GLB (preferred) or GLTF
- **Size**: Keep under 5MB per file for optimal loading
- **License**: Ensure models are CC0 or CC-BY licensed for free use

## Attribution

After downloading, update the credits in the main `README.md` file with proper attribution for each model.
